Changes:
========
Add a constructor in NTCredentials, accept customized NetBios Domain Name to aoid strip on domain name.
This fix below scenario:
	A domain's NetBios name is "my-domain", it's dns name is "mydomain.com"
Before this change, the httpclient will use "mydomain" as domain name in NTLM auth and this name is wrong, the correct one is "my-domain".
